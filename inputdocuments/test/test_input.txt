Exercise 1: Follow the robot

Assume you get your hands on a robot that has various sensors.
a) The robot has a very cheap camera on board, so it's not very accurate at reading
colors. After color calibration you know that the camera color model looks as follows:
z
R
G
B

x

R

G

B

0.8 0.1 0.1
0.1 0.6 0.2
0.1 0.3 0.7

For instance, the probability that the robot reads blue while the true color is green is

p(Z = B|X = G) = 0.3.

Assume the robot is located in a white room with 5 boxes: 2 red, 2 green and a blue
one. The robot moves towards a box and the camera reads green. How likely is it
that the box is actually green?

b) The robot also has a proximity sensor and it uses it to measure its distance from
a door. The sensor's accuracy can be modeled using a continuous random variable
with a Normal distribution with ÄŽÂƒ1 = 0.3 m. Express the sensor model p(zt |xt ) in
the full form (not the shorthand notation).
c) Now the robot moves into a hallway. Initially it knows it is located at the door (x=0).
The robot can execute move commands but the result of the action is not always
perfect. Assume that the robot moves with constant speed v . The motion can also
be modeled with a Gaussian with ÄŽÂƒ2 = 0.1 m. Write the motion model p(xt |xtÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1 , ut ).
d) Programming: Bayes Filter
You let the robot run with a speed of 1 m/s. The robot only runs forward and it
updates its belief every second. Assume you get the following sensor measurements
in the rst 3 seconds: {z1 = 1.2, z2 = 1.6, z3 = 2.5}. Further assume that the hallway
is only 5 meters long. Where does the robot believe it is located with respect to the
door after 3 seconds? How certain is it about its location? Try out dierent standard
deviations for the sensor and the motion model. How does the robot's belief change?

Exercise 2: An overview of ML methods

Try to nd (for example by internet search or from the book (C.M. Bishop)) at least
5 examples for learning techniques that have not been discussed in class. Describe these
techniques briey and classify them with respect to the categories presented in the lecture.
